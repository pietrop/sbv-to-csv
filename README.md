sbv to csv
==========
(youtube captions to google spreadsheet)


A quick ruby script to format captons/transcriptions(.sbv) generated by youtube into a .csv file that can be uploaded seamesly onto a google spreadsheet. 
This is part of a paper editing workflow.


.sbv looks like:

0:00:18.289,0:00:24.340
but the basics would be a format
that works fine

after this script it looks lik this:

0:00:18.289,0:00:24.340,but the basics would be a format,that works fine, 

and it can then be uploaded to google spreadsheet.

note:caption.sbv needs to be in same folder as formatter_to_csv.rb
